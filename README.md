Automated Model Selection and Training System:

This project provides a system for automating the process of model selection, training, and evaluation based on the dataset provided. The system accepts structured and unstructured datasets (e.g., images, text, CSVs) and automatically selects the appropriate machine learning or deep learning model to train based on the nature of the dataset.
(not a complete model trying to make it just making this to try to learn new things and automation techniques in field of ai)
